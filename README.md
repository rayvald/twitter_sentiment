Twitter Sentiment Analysis Challenge for Learn Python for Data Science #2 by @Sirajology on Youtube

##Overview

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library to access the Twitter API and the [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose.

##Changes

For this project I added the option save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. Also generates a circular graph with the label and the percentage of each label.
